# Discord Bot for a Minecraft Server

> This bot allows you and your friends to command the minecraft server directly from your discord. You can configure the commands, roles and many more things inside `config.json`.

### If you ever got tired of waiting for the host of the server to start it, this bot is the perfect solution, because if their PC is open, anyone on the discord group can start and close the minecraft server.

PS : Your antivirus may recognize this script as a threat because of the powershell command used to start the minecraft server.
