# Discord Bot for controlling a Minecraft Server

##### You can command the minecraft server from the discord server, but only with the allowed commands you configured in config.json.

##### You need to specify the path to the already created minecraft server, and install all the modules needed for the script to run

You can use the bot or upgrade it at your own will. I'd be happy if it helps you.
It probably isn't the best and has a lot of bugs but it works :).


*Warning : This script may be recognized by your antivirus as a threat because it executes powershell commands( the java startup of the minecraft server)*
*PS: The names in "allowed-names" must be lowercase in order to work and the "allowed-roles" are case-sensitive*
